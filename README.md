## Technical Details

- Built with React Native/Expo
- Supports both web and mobile platforms
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern, responsive UI design

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or newer
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

### Environment Variables

When running in development mode, the app connects to a local backend by default. In production, it uses the deployed backend URL.

The API base URL is configured in `src/services/api.ts`:

```js
const API_BASE_URL =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? 'https://yayska-backend.vercel.app/api/v1'
    : 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1';
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Deployment:

```
# Test production build locally
npm run build
npx serve dist

# Deploy
# First commit changes
git push origin main  # Vercel automatically deploys
```

## Architecture

The application uses:

- **Expo Router** for file-system based navigation
- **React Native** components for cross-platform UI
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **AsyncStorage** for local data persistence
- **Fetch API** for backend communication

## Key Workflows

1. **User Onboarding**:

   - Users register their children with school years
   - Data persists locally using AsyncStorage

2. **Learning Journey**:

   - Monthly curriculum overview guides focus areas
   - Explore view provides comprehensive subject access
   - Concept details offer in-depth understanding
   - AI chat provides personalized support

3. **Child Management**:
   - Switch between multiple children profiles
   - View appropriate content based on child's education level

## Development Status

Currently in MVP phase, focusing on:

- Primary school subjects
- Core concept explanations
- Basic parent guidance

Future plans include:

- Additional subjects
- Interactive assessments
- AI-powered chat support

## Backend Integration

This frontend connects to a FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend. The API service is configured in `src/services/api.ts`.

## Analytics

Yayska includes a privacy-focused analytics system to understand user journeys and improve the product experience.

### How It Works

- **Session Management**: Uses UUID v4 session IDs for privacy
- **Smart Sessions**: New sessions start on app launch, after 20+ minutes in background, or on new days
- **Privacy First**: Only anonymized usage patterns are tracked, no personal information
- **Reliable**: Analytics failures never break the app experience

### Usage

Track events anywhere in the app:

```typescript
import { trackEvent } from '../utils/analytics';

// Track user interactions
await trackEvent('CONCEPT_CLICKED', {
  concept_id: 123,
  concept_name: 'Addition',
  subject_name: 'Mathematics',
});
```

### What We Track

- User authentication and onboarding flows
- Screen navigation and content interaction
- Learning content engagement patterns
- App usage sessions and timing

### Backend Integration

Events are sent to `POST /api/v1/events/` with the structure:

```json
{
  "event_type": "CONCEPT_CLICKED",
  "payload": { "concept_id": 123, "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00.000Z" },
  "session_id": "uuid-v4-session-id"
}
```

The system is configured in `src/utils/analytics.ts` and automatically initialized in the app layout.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our contributing guidelines for more details.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Connection Issues**: Make sure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8000` in development mode.
- **Build Errors**: Check Node.js version compatibility with the Expo SDK version.
- **AsyncStorage Errors**: May occur when schema changes, try clearing app data or using reset functionality.
